# Monopoly-Simulation
These simulation were made to see the mean number of turns passed before a Monopoly game ends, the mean turn where the last property will be bought and the mean percentage of games where every property was bought. Since there are many different version of Monopoly it has four different types depeding on which rules you choose to follow. The rent will increase every 10 rounds (this number can be changed), meaning that every propery will gain a house/motel on it.
The first game type is where properties are auctioned and free parking does not give 500 dollars.
The second game type is where properties are auctioned and free parking gives 500 dollars.
The third game type is where properties are not auctioned and free parking does not give 500 dollars.
The fourth game type is where properties are not auctioned and free parking gives 500 dollars.

On line 459, the number of players can be indicated and how many game to bootstrap and how many rounds before the rents for every property (whether bought or not) will increase.
Running the code will simulate all the games and produce graphs which show the means and boostrapped values for all three values mentioned above.
